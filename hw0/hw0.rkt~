; ** problem 1 ** (5 points)

; Write a procedure (sum-of-squares x y)
; that takes as arguments integers x and y
; and returns the value of the square of x
; plus the square of y.

; Examples

; (sum-of-squares 3 4) => 25
; (sum-of-squares -2 10) => 104
; (sum-of-squares 0 1) => 1

; ********************************************************

(define (sum-of-squares x y)
    (+ (expt x 2) (expt y 2)))

; ********************************************************
; ** problem 2 ** (4 points)

; Write a procedure (favorite)
; that takes no arguments and
; returns a *string* indicating
; something you like to eat.

; Please remember the difference between
; a procedure call and the evaluation
; of a variable!

; Example (yours will likely be different)

; (favorite) => "pizza with artichoke hearts"

; ********************************************************

(define (favorite)
    (string->immutable-string "Avocado Mozzarella Sandwich"))
